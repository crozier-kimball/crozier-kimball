I like figuring out how things actually work.
Especially when the problem is messy, the data is imperfect, and the answer isn’t obvious.

Most of what I build sits at the intersection of strategy, operations, and data. I enjoy breaking complex systems into something understandable, then turning that understanding into tools people actually use.

I enjoy:
- Turning vague questions into clear decisions
- Fuilding metrics people actually trust
- Finding the edge cases where systems break

**Currently**
- Strategy & ops work at a dental services scale-up
- Finishing my mba at IESE (spring 2026)
- Building an AI-assisted job search system
